# Crushing Bugs

We got two bugs. First one is that we were able to drag and drop
more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone, which is I fixed.

The other one is that pieces appearing in the drop zones on reset.I couldn't make it.



## Dependencies
At first, I was trying to declare parents and child. so tried to use "console.log('zone has child nodes',zone.hasChildNodes());" and figured out it is not relevant.
Fortunately, I figured that I can use "elementCount" for fitting on the zone. I was so glad that I got the point.

For the different bug, I tried to use "clear.Data" and "querySelector". I still have no clue.
